# Coordinate Reference systems
### Coordinate systems:
>[!note] Definition
>**Coordinate systems** are the mathematical basis in the metric space that define the conventions and the order of the coordinate locations.
>
>**Coordinate systems** are built form an *orthonormal basis unit vectors* called basis or triad. The basis axes are *linearly independent* and share the origin point
- Cartesian coordinates describe position while spherical/elliptical coordinates are mainly orientational.
- The metric tensor describes us how far two points are in each unit of distance in the system on the manifold (allows us to define distances on a manifold in different systems).
### Reference systems:
##### Terminology:
- **Solar System Barycenter:** the center of mass of every object in the solar system combined.
- **Principal Plane:** The plain (Declination = 0) of an orientational coordinate system.
- **Declination:** Angle from vector to the equatorial plain.
- **Inclination:** Angle from vector to pole.
- **Azimuth:** for an observer the azimuth is the horizontal angle from the north.
- **Zenith:** for an observer the zenith is the direct vector upwards (Plumb line: The local gravity direction).
- **Celestial plane:** is the plane that uses the celestial equator projected across the universe, and the celestial equator is earth's equator.
- **Ecliptic plane:** the plane that models the orbit of earth around the sun.
- **ECEF:** rotates with earths rotation 
- **ECI:** doesnt rotate with earth, so coordinates change over time.
- **Inertial system:** Non-accelerating system i.e velocity is constant and it does not rotate, newtonian lines apply thus a mass at rest will have F=0 (no ficticous forces).
- **Non-inertial systems:** Accelerating system i.e velocity is changing whether in speed or direction, in order to model mass at rest we add ficticious forces in space because gravity is seen as deformation of space time not a force.

>[!note] Definition
>Modelling earths instantaneous orientation, due to many earth and celestial processes.
>Used to transform from an ECEF to ECI systems.
##### Polar Motion:
>[!Note] Definition
>natural movement of Earths rotational axis relative to its surface which causes the geographic locations of the North and South Poles to slowly drift over time.
- **Components:**
	- *Perioidic:*
		- Chandler wobble: driven by movement in Earths internal structure such as Mantle convection, tectonic shifts.
		- Annual Wobble: caused by more seasonal changes like air pressure distribution of water and ocean currents.
	- *Long term effects:*
		- Polar Wander:  mass redistribution on Earths surface including Intrinsic processes like mass pumping of ground water, icecaps melting, the dynamics of the liquid outer core, particularly the motion of molten iron, tectonic plate movement, Isostatic adjustments.
##### Precession and Nutation:
>[!Note] Definition
>**Precession** is the slow, conical movement of Earth's rotational axis around pole of ecliptic.
>**Nutation** is a periodic version of Precession.
- **Causes:**
	- caused by gravitational forces applying torque (change in angular momentum) onto a rotating object. This is mainly exerted by the closest and the densest objects namely the moon and sun.
	- *Tidal Friction:*
		- The moons gravity makes bulges in earths shape (Oceans especially).
		- Earth rotates faster than the moon's orbit.
		- This causes the moon to pull back on those bulges and apply torque on earth slowing it down.
		- The bulges also apply torque on the moon causes it to go further from earth to conserve angular momentum.
		- This causes period changes in the axis.

- Orbital period is proportional to semi major axis or orbit.
###### Orbital Energy:
- Objects in orbit exhibit potential and Kinetic energy.
- Due to energy conservation, it will always balance out in a stable orbit.
- In circular orbits the energy does not exchange.
- In ellipsoidal energy the kinetic energy gets bigger around the periapsis because the potential energy decreases and vice versa.

###### Ranging Methods:
- Using radio frequencies from 10kHZ to 300GHZ.
- Time of Flight: The atomic clock records time of transmission on satellite and send the signal to earth which is then compared with time of arrival while accounting for clock errors, multipled by the speed of light to get the range.
- **Code ranging:** 
	- Uses PRN on both sides and measures the misalignment of the signal after arrival.
	- Complex and mm accuracy but sensitive to obstructions
	- Different receiver and sender clock errors are taken into account.
	- Clock correction and orbit parameters are sent by satellite.
	- $R = c(T_{r}- T_{s}) + c(u_{r}- u_{s}) + (\alpha_{r}- \alpha_{s})$
- **Carrier Phase:**
	- Electromagnetic waves are harmonics and have a phase, which is the angle of the signal in its cycle.
	- 2 x pi x f: is the angular velocity of that wave.
	- Meters accuracy and simple
	- This introduces an integer ambiguity term that is constant to account for how many cycles have passed.
	- Signal is also received with doppler effect according to the relative velocities.
	- $R = c(T_{r}- T_{s}) + c(u_{r}- u_{s}) + \lambda(N + \alpha_{r}- \alpha_{s})$
- **Biases:**
	- Ionospheric refraction
	- Tropospheric refraction

###### Data recording approaches:
- *Static:* Stationary for hours + post processing
	- *Post processing:* Analyzed and refined using data correction
- *Kinematic:* the receiver is moving or stop and going.
	- *Real time:* provides live positioning as its pre processed during collection.
- *Absolute:* a single GNSS receiver is determined directly with reference to the satellite positions (10-30m)
	- *Precise Point Positioning:* use precise satellite orbit and clock corrections available from external sources to improve positioning accuracy.
- *Relative:* the position of a receiver is determined relative to the base station (mm-cm)
	- *RTK (semi kinematic):* The base station broadcasts correction data to the rover in real time, allowing for accurate position estimates, uses both carrier and code. (1-3cm)
- *Differential:* uses a known reference point to correct for errors (computed at stations and sent to rover) which are then broadcast to the rover using differential techniques. (1-2m)
###### Augmentations:
- systems designed to enhance the performance of (GNSS) by improving accuracy and availability.

**Assisted GPS:** Mobile Station Based A-GPS, the device  computes position using assistance data (ephemeris, almanac) passed down from cellular networks and reports geographical coordinates back to the network.

###### Remote sensing
- **Reflectometry:**
	- analyze signals from GNSS after they reflect off the Earth's surface.
	- This reflection has key properties that describe several different characteristics and properties it has went through.
	-  Surface roughness, reflectivity, interference patterns.
- **Radio Occultation:**
	- profiles the atmosphere by analyzing GNSS signals as they graze Earths limb.
	- Occulation occurs when a GNSS satellite sets or rises relative to a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The signal path passes through successive atmospheric layers  and bends due to atmospheric refraction.
- **Ground based:**
	- delays and distortion in the GNSS signals can be leveraged to derive critical atmospheric parameters.
	- This can either be measured with Zenith Total Delay which provides information about the wet and dry troposphere.
	- or measured by Slant Total Delay (slanted path) to provide more information about atmospheric heterogeneity.

# Geodetic Techniques:
#### VLBI:
- VLBI is a radio interferometry technique that uses multiple widely separated telescopes (baselines of thousands of kilometers) to simulate a single, enormous telescope.
- It looks at compact cosmic sources that are practically fixed and reads in the signals from them.
- The key goal is to achieve extremely high angular resolution, proportional to the baseline length divided by the observing wavelength.
- data from all stations are combined in a correlator.
- Any apparent motion lets us derive EOP from earths orientation like xp yp UT1.
#### DORIS:
- One way doppler system where ground beacons emit signals that are observed by satellites at diff positions to derive the doppler shifted frequencies for accurate orbit determination.
#### SLR:
- Measures the distance between ground stations and satellites using laser pulses.
- SLR retroreflectors have three mutually perpendicular reflective surfaces which ensures the outgoing light is directed back toward the source regardless of the prism's orientation.
- Accounts for earth rotation over instaneous station position (with fluctuations and short term deformations like tides) and regularized station position (averaged over time) and orbital parameters.
#### PRARE:
-  The ground station transmits a coded microwave signal (X/S-band) to the satellite.
- The satellites PRARE system receives the signal, filters it, decodes the data,  sends it back with extra site-specific low-rate information.
- By correlating the transmitted and received signals, PRARE calculates the time delay (for range) and frequency shift (for range-rate).
#### Altimetry
- Its mainly used in understanding and monitoring global sea level rise alongside Studying ice sheet thickness, coastal processes, and inland water bodies.
- The radio waves are sent to the ocean surface which are first reflected as a point reflection then as a cirlcle then as a disc which has a specific curve that it displays in the reciever signal.
- we can infer significant wave height, wind speed, rainfall, floating ice presence, and many others.
- Corrections include:
	- orbit errors
	- instrumental effects
	- ionospheric refraction (Ionized particles)
	- tropospheric refraction both dry and wet which is why we try to estimate water vapor content with radiometer.
	- target surface effects like tides.
- Dynamic Ocean Topography is the deviation of the sea surface height (SSH) from the geoid.
# Gravity missions:
- the satellite orbit is numerically integrated in an inertial reference system to be able to detect the forces that act upon the satellite. however the forces can be gravitational and nongravitational effects
- Computed - Observed residuals help us improve out computed orbit to model more forces.
- We optimize spherical harmonic coefficients to fit this as best as we can and this varies with location and time.

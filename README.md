You need to install obsidian and the following community plugins in order to view these canvases properly:
#### MAKE SURE TO ENABLE THE PLUGINS IN THE SETTINGS AFTER INSTALL
1. Excalidraw: Visual notes (Without this you cannot view 95% of the notes)
2. Latex Suite: Latex integration (Without this the latex format might be a little different, im not 100% sure)
3. Spaced repition: Study cards (Without this you cannot view any future cards I make, Currently there are none though)

QoL plugins I use but are not necessary:
1. Better Word Count: Estimating word count in files and folders better
2. Annotator: Used to annotate pdf files
3. Excalibrain: Excalidraw styled graph view
4. Iconize: gives icons to files
5. Vault statistics: statistics for overall vault

Editing plugins I use for writing, but are not necessary for viewing:
1. Latex OCR: generates Latex format from pasted image
2. Quick latex: auto-completes Latex
3. Find Orphaned files: Management of unused media
4. Dataview: Have not used it yet, but enables queries for tables
